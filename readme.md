# Trading System Terminology Dictionary

## Core Components

### Trading Entities
- **Exchange** - a platform for trading cryptocurrencies (e.g., Binance, Kraken)
- **Market** - a specific market on an exchange, such as futures or spot
- **Pair** - an abstract pair of traded assets, e.g., BTC/USDT, not tied to a specific exchange
- **Instrument** - a specific trading pair tied to a specific market (and therefore a specific exchange)

### Analytical Components
- **Portfolio** - a virtual wallet with assets, tracks balance and positions
- **Metric** - a component for generating metrics. Example: difference between opening and closing prices
- **Signal** - a component for generating signals based on metrics. Example: if open > close, then buy; if open < close, then sell

### Trading Components
- **Strategy** - takes a signal as input and outputs instructions for the bot
- **Bot** - code that knows how to trade based on a signal or without one
- **Bot Instance** - an instance of a bot that takes a strategy and portfolio as input and generates trading orders

## Basic Definitions

### Exchange
A platform for trading assets that enables buying and selling. Examples include "binance", "bybit", and "okx".

### Market Type
Types of markets that can be represented on exchanges. Example: "spot" (spot market), "futures" (futures market).

### Market
A specific type of market on an exchange, such as spot, futures, or margin trading. Example: "binance/spot"

### Pair (Trading Pair)
A trading pair consists of two parts: baseId/quoteId
- baseId - base currency (what is bought/sold)
- quoteId - quote currency (in which the price is denominated)

Examples:
- BTC/USDT: baseId=BTC, quoteId=USDT (price in USDT)
- TON/BTC: baseId=TON, quoteId=BTC (price in BTC)
- LTC/BNB: baseId=LTC, quoteId=BNB (price in BNB)

For calculating wall volume in USDT:
1. If quoteId is USDT - volume is calculated directly (price * amount)
2. For any pair baseId/quoteId:
   - Take bestBid from the baseId/USDT orderbook
   - Volume in USDT = (price * amount) * bestBid_baseId_USDT

After calculating the volume in USDT, we can compare it with min_usdt to find significant walls.

### Instrument
A specific trading pair tied to a market. Example: "BTC/USDT/binance/spot" (BTC/USDT on Binance Spot Market).

### Portfolio
A virtual wallet containing assets that can be used for trading.

### Metric
A component that generates metrics based on market data (e.g., the difference between opening and closing prices).

### Signal
A signal is a discrete event or state that has:
1. A clear start (timestampStart)
2. A possible end (timestampEnd)
3. Specific parameters

Examples of signals:
- Trading signal: "Buy BTC/USDT now at a price of 40000"
- Trend signal: "BTC/USDT is in a sideways movement from 12:00 to 14:00"

Important: do not confuse signals with metrics. A metric is a continuous series of data (e.g., a price chart or indicator), while a signal is a specific event or state at a particular moment or period of time.

Signals can:
1. Be generated based on metric analysis
2. Be converted into metrics for visualization
3. Form a history for subsequent analysis

### Strategy
Takes signals as input and outputs instructions for the trading bot.

### Bot
Code that knows how to perform trading operations based on signals or other predefined logical rules.

### Bot Instance
A running instance of a bot that generates trading orders based on a strategy and portfolio.

### Density (alternative: Wall)
In the context of an orderbook, "density" or "wall" is the volume of orders at a specific price level.

Examples:
- Buy wall (bids density) - a large volume of buy orders at a certain price level. For example, if there are buy orders for BTC at a price of 40000 USDT with a total volume of 1000000 USDT, this is a large "wall" of buyers. To break through this wall downward (for the price to fall below 40000), one would need to sell BTC worth more than 1000000 USDT.
- Sell wall (asks density) - a large volume of sell orders at a certain price level.

Calculating the maximum wall:
1. Take midPrice as the base price
2. Define the search range: midPrice Â± (midPrice * look_in_percent)
3. Within this range, search for:
   - For bids: the first order from midPrice downward where the volume in USDT > min_usdt
   - For asks: the first order from midPrice upward where the volume in USDT > min_usdt
4. For each wall found, record:
   - The wall volume in USDT from the orderbook
   - At what percentage from midPrice it is located (e.g.: -0.5% for bids or +0.7% for asks)

## Notes
- One Exchange can have multiple Markets
- One Market can contain multiple Instruments
- One Pair can be represented on different Markets as different Instruments
- Signal uses Metric for market analysis
- Strategy uses Signal for decision making
- Bot Instance uses Strategy to generate specific trading actions

## Metrics and Signals in Trading Systems

### Metrics
A metric is a continuous series of data tied to a timeline (timeseries). Each metric point has a timestamp.

Types of metrics:
1. **Simple boolean metrics** - buy/sell signals
```python
[
    [1623456789, true],   # buy
    [1623456790, false],  # no signal
    [1623456791, false],  # no signal
    [1623456792, true]    # buy
]
```

2. **Numeric state metrics** - e.g., market trend
```python
[
    [1623456789, 0],   # flat
    [1623456790, -1],  # down trend
    [1623456791, 1],   # up trend
    [1623456792, 0]    # flat
]
```

3. **Complex metrics** - e.g., OHLCV data
```python
[
    [1623456789, {open: 100, high: 105, low: 98, close: 103, volume: 1000}],
    [1623456790, {open: 103, high: 107, low: 102, close: 106, volume: 1200}]
]
```

### Signals
A signal is an event or state that has:
1. A clear start (timestampStart)
2. A possible end (timestampEnd)
3. Specific parameters

Examples of signals:
1. **Trading signal**
```python
{
    "id": "uuid-1",
    "type": "trade",
    "action": "buy",        # buy now
    "price": 100.50,
    "timestampStart": 1623456789,
    "active": true
}
```

2. **Trend signal**
```python
{
    "id": "uuid-2",
    "type": "trend",
    "direction": "flat",    # sideways trend
    "timestampStart": 1623456789,
    "timestampEnd": 1623456999,
    "minMaxs": 3,          # found 3 maximums
    "minMins": 3,          # found 3 minimums
    "active": true
}
```

### Relationship between metrics and signals
1. Metrics can be used to generate signals
   - Analysis of OHLCV metrics can generate a trend signal
   - Analysis of volume metrics can generate a signal about high activity

2. Signals can be converted into metrics for visualization
   - A trend signal can be converted into a spline for display on a chart
   - Trading signals can be converted into points on a chart

3. Signal history can form a metric
   - A sequence of buy/sell signals forms a boolean metric
   - A sequence of trend signals forms a market state metric

## Trading Charts and Data Analysis

### Candles and OHLCV
Candles (candlesticks) are a visualization tool that displays price movements over a specific period. Each candle contains OHLCV data:

- **O (Open)** - opening price of the period
- **H (High)** - maximum price reached during the period
- **L (Low)** - minimum price reached during the period
- **C (Close)** - closing price of the period
- **V (Volume)** - total trading volume during the period

Candles aggregate individual trades that occurred during a specific time interval into a single visual element, simplifying price movement analysis. The candle structure includes:

- **Candle body** - a rectangle showing the difference between opening and closing prices
- **Color** - typically green (or white) for bullish candles (close > open) and red for bearish candles (close < open)
- **Shadows/Wicks** - lines extending above and below the body, showing maximum and minimum prices
- **Upper shadow** - line from the top of the body to the maximum price
- **Lower shadow** - line from the bottom of the body to the minimum price

### Timeframes
The time interval for which candles and OHLCV data are formed. Common timeframes include:

- **m1, m5, m15, m30** - 1, 5, 15, 30 minutes
- **h1, h4** - 1, 4 hours
- **d1** - 1 day
- **w1** - 1 week
- **M1** - 1 month

Timeframes allow traders to view market data with different resolutions. Shorter timeframes (e.g., m1, m5) show more details but may contain more market noise, while longer timeframes (e.g., d1, w1, M1) display broader market trends.

### Candlestick Patterns
Specific combinations of candles that may indicate potential trend reversals or continuation:

- **Bullish Engulfing** - a reversal pattern where a bullish candle completely engulfs the previous bearish candle
- **Hammer** - a potential signal for a downtrend reversal, characterized by a small body and a long lower shadow
- **Doji** - a candle with a very small body, indicating market indecision

  - Narrowing the spread between buy and sell prices
  - Stabilizing the market during periods of volatility
  - Generating profit primarily from the spread
  - Balancing the orderbook and maintaining market depth
- **Market Manipulator** - a market participant who deliberately influences an asset's price to profit from price changes. Main strategies:
  - **Self-Trading** - creating an illusion of activity through transactions between related addresses; used to trade against copy traders (forcing them to copy losing trades)
  - **Price-Setting** - placing large orders without intending to fully execute them to create a false impression of supply/demand

## Derivatives Trading

#### Futures Contracts
- **Perpetual Futures** - a type of futures contract without an expiration date, which mimics the spot market but with the possibility of using leverage. The price is pegged to the spot price index through a funding rate mechanism.
- **Funding Rate** - regular payments between holders of long and short positions in perpetual futures. If the rate is positive, longs pay shorts; if negative, shorts pay longs. This helps keep the futures price close to the spot price.
- **Initial Margin** - the minimum amount of funds a trader must deposit to open a leveraged position. Calculated as a percentage of the total position size.
- **Maintenance Margin** - the minimum margin level that must be maintained in an account after opening a position. If the account balance falls below this level, a margin call or liquidation occurs.
- **Liquidation** - the forced closure of a trader's position by the exchange when their margin falls below the maintenance margin level. This is done to prevent further losses that could exceed the trader's account funds.

#### Options Contracts
- **Call Option** - a contract giving the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy the underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) within a certain period or on a specific date (expiration date).
- **Put Option** - a contract giving the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) within a certain period or on a specific date (expiration date).
- **Strike Price** - the price at which the option holder can buy (for a call option) or sell (for a put option) the underlying asset.
- **Expiration Date** - the date after which the option contract becomes invalid.
- **Greeks** - a set of metrics used to measure various aspects of an option position's risk:
  - **Delta** - measures the sensitivity of an option's price to a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset.
  - **Gamma** - measures the rate of change of an option's delta as the price of the underlying asset changes.
  - **Theta** - measures the decrease in an option's value over time (time decay).
  - **Vega** - measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the implied volatility of the underlying asset.

## Market Microstructure Analysis
- **Order Flow** - analysis of the sequence of orders entering the market
- **Orderbook Imbalance** - the ratio of volumes on the buy and sell sides
- **Market Impact** - price change resulting from the execution of a large order
- **Cluster Analysis** - studying trading volumes at different price levels

## Risk Management and Trading Psychology
- **Expected Return** - the mathematical expectation of a trading strategy's result

  - **FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt)** - the spread of negative, often unconfirmed information to cause panic and lower an asset's price for subsequent purchase at a lower price or to discredit a competitor.
  - **Confirmation Bias** - the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.
  - **Overconfidence** - a cognitive bias in which a person's subjective confidence in their judgments and abilities is greater than their objective accuracy, which can lead to taking excessive risks.
- **Trading Journal** - a systematic record of all trades and their analysis

- **Flash Loans** - a special type of uncollateralized loans in DeFi that must be borrowed and repaid within a single blockchain transaction. Used for arbitrage, refinancing, and other complex operations.
- **MEV (Miner Extractable Value / Maximum Extractable Value)** - the maximum value that miners (in Proof-of-Work networks) or validators (in Proof-of-Stake networks) can extract from block production beyond the standard block reward and transaction fees, by including, excluding, or reordering transactions within a block.

#### Tokenomics
- **Minting** - the process of creating new tokens. This can occur according to a predefined algorithm (e.g., in Proof-of-Stake during staking) or by the decision of the project team.
- **Vesting** - the process of gradually unlocking tokens distributed to the project team, advisors, or early investors. Usually occurs on a specific schedule to prevent a sharp drop in token price.
- **Token Burn** - the process of permanently removing a certain number of tokens from circulation. Used to reduce the total supply of tokens, which can potentially increase their value.
