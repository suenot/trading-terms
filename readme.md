# Trading System Terminology Dictionary

## Core Components

### Trading Entities
- **Exchange** - a platform for trading cryptocurrencies (e.g., Binance, Kraken)
- **Market** - a specific market on an exchange, such as futures or spot
- **Pair** - an abstract pair of traded assets, e.g., BTC/USDT, not tied to a specific exchange
- **Instrument** - a specific trading pair tied to a specific market (and therefore a specific exchange)

### Analytical Components
- **Portfolio** - a virtual wallet with assets, tracks balance and positions
- **Metric** - a component for generating metrics. Example: difference between opening and closing prices
- **Signal** - a component for generating signals based on metrics. Example: if open > close, then buy; if open < close, then sell

### Trading Components
- **Strategy** - takes a signal as input and outputs instructions for the bot
- **Bot** - code that knows how to trade based on a signal or without one
- **Bot Instance** - an instance of a bot that takes a strategy and portfolio as input and generates trading orders

## Basic Definitions

### Exchange
A platform for trading assets that enables buying and selling. Examples include "binance", "bybit", and "okx".

### Market Type
Types of markets that can be represented on exchanges. Example: "spot" (spot market), "futures" (futures market).

### Market
A specific type of market on an exchange, such as spot, futures, or margin trading. Example: "binance/spot"

### Pair (Trading Pair)
A trading pair consists of two parts: baseId/quoteId
- baseId - base currency (what is bought/sold)
- quoteId - quote currency (in which the price is denominated)

Examples:
- BTC/USDT: baseId=BTC, quoteId=USDT (price in USDT)
- TON/BTC: baseId=TON, quoteId=BTC (price in BTC)
- LTC/BNB: baseId=LTC, quoteId=BNB (price in BNB)

For calculating wall volume in USDT:
1. If quoteId is USDT - volume is calculated directly (price * amount)
2. For any pair baseId/quoteId:
   - Take bestBid from the baseId/USDT orderbook
   - Volume in USDT = (price * amount) * bestBid_baseId_USDT

After calculating the volume in USDT, we can compare it with min_usdt to find significant walls.

### Instrument
A specific trading pair tied to a market. Example: "BTC/USDT/binance/spot" (BTC/USDT on Binance Spot Market).

### Portfolio
A virtual wallet containing assets that can be used for trading.

### Metric
A component that generates metrics based on market data (e.g., the difference between opening and closing prices).

### Signal
A signal is a discrete event or state that has:
1. A clear start (timestampStart)
2. A possible end (timestampEnd)
3. Specific parameters

Examples of signals:
- Trading signal: "Buy BTC/USDT now at a price of 40000"
- Trend signal: "BTC/USDT is in a sideways movement from 12:00 to 14:00"

Important: do not confuse signals with metrics. A metric is a continuous series of data (e.g., a price chart or indicator), while a signal is a specific event or state at a particular moment or period of time.

Signals can:
1. Be generated based on metric analysis
2. Be converted into metrics for visualization
3. Form a history for subsequent analysis

### Strategy
Takes signals as input and outputs instructions for the trading bot.

### Bot
Code that knows how to perform trading operations based on signals or other predefined logical rules.

### Bot Instance
A running instance of a bot that generates trading orders based on a strategy and portfolio.

### Density (alternative: Wall)
In the context of an orderbook, "density" or "wall" is the volume of orders at a specific price level.

Examples:
- Buy wall (bids density) - a large volume of buy orders at a certain price level. For example, if there are buy orders for BTC at a price of 40000 USDT with a total volume of 1000000 USDT, this is a large "wall" of buyers. To break through this wall downward (for the price to fall below 40000), one would need to sell BTC worth more than 1000000 USDT.
- Sell wall (asks density) - a large volume of sell orders at a certain price level.

Calculating the maximum wall:
1. Take midPrice as the base price
2. Define the search range: midPrice Â± (midPrice * look_in_percent)
3. Within this range, search for:
   - For bids: the first order from midPrice downward where the volume in USDT > min_usdt
   - For asks: the first order from midPrice upward where the volume in USDT > min_usdt
4. For each wall found, record:
   - The wall volume in USDT from the orderbook
   - At what percentage from midPrice it is located (e.g.: -0.5% for bids or +0.7% for asks)

## Notes
- One Exchange can have multiple Markets
- One Market can contain multiple Instruments
- One Pair can be represented on different Markets as different Instruments
- Signal uses Metric for market analysis
- Strategy uses Signal for decision making
- Bot Instance uses Strategy to generate specific trading actions

## Metrics and Signals in Trading Systems

### Metrics
A metric is a continuous series of data tied to a timeline (timeseries). Each metric point has a timestamp.

Types of metrics:
1. **Simple boolean metrics** - buy/sell signals
```python
[
    [1623456789, true],   # buy
    [1623456790, false],  # no signal
    [1623456791, false],  # no signal
    [1623456792, true]    # buy
]
```

2. **Numeric state metrics** - e.g., market trend
```python
[
    [1623456789, 0],   # flat
    [1623456790, -1],  # down trend
    [1623456791, 1],   # up trend
    [1623456792, 0]    # flat
]
```

3. **Complex metrics** - e.g., OHLCV data
```python
[
    [1623456789, {open: 100, high: 105, low: 98, close: 103, volume: 1000}],
    [1623456790, {open: 103, high: 107, low: 102, close: 106, volume: 1200}]
]
```

### Signals
A signal is an event or state that has:
1. A clear start (timestampStart)
2. A possible end (timestampEnd)
3. Specific parameters

Examples of signals:
1. **Trading signal**
```python
{
    "id": "uuid-1",
    "type": "trade",
    "action": "buy",        # buy now
    "price": 100.50,
    "timestampStart": 1623456789,
    "active": true
}
```

2. **Trend signal**
```python
{
    "id": "uuid-2",
    "type": "trend",
    "direction": "flat",    # sideways trend
    "timestampStart": 1623456789,
    "timestampEnd": 1623456999,
    "minMaxs": 3,          # found 3 maximums
    "minMins": 3,          # found 3 minimums
    "active": true
}
```

### Relationship between metrics and signals
1. Metrics can be used to generate signals
   - Analysis of OHLCV metrics can generate a trend signal
   - Analysis of volume metrics can generate a signal about high activity

2. Signals can be converted into metrics for visualization
   - A trend signal can be converted into a spline for display on a chart
   - Trading signals can be converted into points on a chart

3. Signal history can form a metric
   - A sequence of buy/sell signals forms a boolean metric
   - A sequence of trend signals forms a market state metric

## Trading Charts and Data Analysis

### Candles and OHLCV
Candles (candlesticks) are a visualization tool that displays price movements over a specific period. Each candle contains OHLCV data:

- **O (Open)** - opening price of the period
- **H (High)** - maximum price reached during the period
- **L (Low)** - minimum price reached during the period
- **C (Close)** - closing price of the period
- **V (Volume)** - total trading volume during the period

Candles aggregate individual trades that occurred during a specific time interval into a single visual element, simplifying price movement analysis. The candle structure includes:

- **Candle body** - a rectangle showing the difference between opening and closing prices
- **Color** - typically green (or white) for bullish candles (close > open) and red for bearish candles (close < open)
- **Shadows/Wicks** - lines extending above and below the body, showing maximum and minimum prices
- **Upper shadow** - line from the top of the body to the maximum price
- **Lower shadow** - line from the bottom of the body to the minimum price

### Timeframes
The time interval for which candles and OHLCV data are formed. Common timeframes include:

- **m1, m5, m15, m30** - 1, 5, 15, 30 minutes
- **h1, h4** - 1, 4 hours
- **d1** - 1 day
- **w1** - 1 week
- **M1** - 1 month

Timeframes allow traders to view market data with different resolutions. Shorter timeframes (e.g., m1, m5) show more details but may contain more market noise, while longer timeframes (e.g., d1, w1, M1) display broader market trends.

### Candlestick Patterns
Specific combinations of candles that may indicate potential trend reversals or continuation:

- **Bullish Engulfing** - a reversal pattern where a bullish candle completely engulfs the previous bearish candle
- **Hammer** - a potential signal for a downtrend reversal, characterized by a small body and a long lower shadow
- **Doji** - a candle with a very small body, indicating market indecision

- **Market Making Strategies** - systematic approaches used by market makers to provide liquidity while managing risk and generating profit, typically involving simultaneous placement of buy and sell orders at different price levels with the goal of capturing the spread.
- **Order Book Depth** - a measure of the volume of orders at different price levels in the order book, indicating the market's ability to absorb large trades without significant price impact; deeper order books generally suggest higher liquidity.
- **Liquidity Aggregation** - the process of combining liquidity from multiple sources, such as different exchanges or trading venues, to provide traders with better pricing, deeper order books, and improved execution quality.

- **Order Protection Rule** - a regulatory requirement or system feature designed to prevent orders from being executed at inferior prices when better prices are available on other trading venues, ensuring best execution for traders.
- **Best Execution** - the obligation of brokers and trading systems to execute client orders on the most favorable terms available, considering factors such as price, speed, likelihood of execution, and overall cost.
- **Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)** - a process of evaluating and measuring the costs associated with trading activities, including explicit costs (commissions, fees) and implicit costs (slippage, market impact), to assess execution quality and optimize trading strategies.
- **Slippage Control** - techniques and tools used to minimize the difference between the expected and actual execution price of a trade, such as setting slippage limits, using limit orders, or employing advanced execution algorithms.
- **Quote Matching** - the process by which a trading system or exchange compares and pairs buy and sell quotes/orders based on price, time, and other criteria to facilitate trade execution.
- **Order Throttling** - the practice of limiting the rate at which orders can be submitted to a trading system or exchange, typically to prevent system overload, reduce risk, and ensure fair access for all participants.
- **Order Acknowledgement** - a confirmation message sent by a trading system or exchange to notify the sender that an order has been received and accepted for processing, providing assurance of order status.
- **Order Fill Confirmation** - a notification sent by a trading system or exchange to inform the trader that an order, or part of it, has been executed, including details such as price, quantity, and time of execution.
- **Drop Copy** - a real-time copy of trade and order messages sent to a third-party system (such as risk management or compliance) for monitoring, auditing, or backup purposes.
- **Heartbeat Message** - a periodic message exchanged between systems to confirm connectivity and session health, ensuring that communication channels remain active and responsive.
- **Session Management** - the processes and controls used to establish, maintain, and terminate communication sessions between trading systems, including authentication, authorization, and recovery from interruptions.
- **Disaster Recovery** - strategies and procedures for restoring trading operations and data after a major system failure, cyberattack, or other catastrophic event, ensuring business continuity and regulatory compliance.
- **UDP Multicast** - a network communication method that allows data to be sent from one source to multiple recipients simultaneously, commonly used for distributing market data feeds with low latency.
- **TCP/IP** - the foundational suite of communication protocols used for interconnecting network devices on the internet, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
- **WebSocket** - a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, widely used for real-time data streaming in trading platforms and exchanges.
- **REST API** - a web service interface based on Representational State Transfer principles, enabling programmatic access to trading and market data using standard HTTP methods.
- **gRPC** - a high-performance, open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization, suitable for low-latency trading system integration.
- **DMA (Direct Market Access)** - a technology that enables traders to place orders directly into the order books of exchanges, bypassing intermediaries and allowing for faster execution, lower latency, and greater control over trading strategies.

## Trading and Market Data Protocols
- **FIX Protocol** - the Financial Information eXchange protocol, a widely used electronic communications protocol for real-time exchange of securities transactions and market data between financial institutions.
- **FIX/Fast** - a high-performance binary encoding protocol developed as an extension to FIX, designed to reduce bandwidth and latency for market data and trading messages.
- **Plaza2** - a proprietary high-speed trading and market data protocol used by the Moscow Exchange, optimized for low-latency electronic trading environments.

## Cryptocurrency-Specific Terms
- **DEX (Decentralized Exchange)** - a decentralized exchange operating without a central intermediary
- **AMM (Automated Market Maker)** - an automated market maker used in DEXs
- **Liquidity Pool** - a pool of liquidity in decentralized protocols
- **Impermanent Loss** - temporary value loss when providing liquidity in AMMs

#### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
- **Yield Farming** - the process of earning rewards (often in the form of additional tokens) for providing liquidity or staking cryptocurrencies in DeFi protocols.
- **Staking** - the process of holding cryptocurrency in a wallet or on a special platform to support blockchain operations (e.g., validating transactions in Proof-of-Stake networks) and earn rewards.
- **Liquidity Mining** - a type of yield farming where users receive protocol governance tokens in exchange for providing liquidity.
- **Wrapped Assets** - tokens that represent an asset from another blockchain. For example, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is an ERC-20 token whose value is pegged to Bitcoin, allowing BTC to be used in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.
- **Oracles** - services that supply smart contracts with real-world data (e.g., currency exchange rates, sports event outcomes) necessary for their correct operation.
- **Flash Loans** - a special type of uncollateralized loans in DeFi that must be borrowed and repaid within a single blockchain transaction. Used for arbitrage, refinancing, and other complex operations.
- **MEV (Miner Extractable Value / Maximum Extractable Value)** - the maximum value that miners (in Proof-of-Work networks) or validators (in Proof-of-Stake networks) can extract from block production beyond the standard block reward and transaction fees, by including, excluding, or reordering transactions within a block.

#### Tokenomics
- **Minting** - the process of creating new tokens. This can occur according to a predefined algorithm (e.g., in Proof-of-Stake during staking) or by the decision of the project team.
- **Vesting** - the process of gradually unlocking tokens distributed to the project team, advisors, or early investors. Usually occurs on a specific schedule to prevent a sharp drop in token price.
- **Token Burn** - the process of permanently removing a certain number of tokens from circulation. Used to reduce the total supply of tokens, which can potentially increase their value.
